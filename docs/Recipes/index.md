# Recipes

The Summit Events App is built with native Salesforce functionality. Because of the native aspects of the application, there are a number of recipies to extend the functionality of Summit Events.  Please review and test all recipes in a Sandbox prior to putting anything in a Production environment.

If you have a recipe to contribute, let us know so we can have it formally added to this section!
