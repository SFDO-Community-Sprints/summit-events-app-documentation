## Create an Event Email ##
Summit Events makes it easy to send an automated email to your registrant based on their registration action status.  This feature is a transactional based feature meaning that it sends emails based on changes to the registrant's status.  It is not meant for bulk messaging.  For example, the Director of Career Services could use this feature to send an email to the registrant when they register for her career services event.  Let's take a look at the steps it takes to create the email message.  This post will cover the basic features that will work for most simple events.  

**1. Click the New button**

Starting from the existing Summit Event record, locate the Summit Events Emails related list and click the New button.  Depending upon how your system is configured, the related list may be found in the Related List Quick Links area at the top of the event, if that is the case, hover over the link to access the New button.  If it is found along the right-side of the event screen or bottom of the event page with other related lists, click on the drop-down arrow and choose New. When creating a new email from the event, the event name populated automatically.

**2. Select the appropriate Action and Sub Action Status**

Choose the Action Registered from the Action Status drop-down. Registered is chosen because the person should receive the email when they complete the registration process. Sub Action Status is optional.  No Sub Action Statuses are being used for this event so this is left blank.

**3. Enter the Subject**

Using the Subject field, enter a meaningful subject for the email. This is what shows as the subject to the person receiving the email message.

**4. Enter the Email Content**

Using the rich text editor, enter the deails of the email into the Email Content Field.  This is what will appear in the body of the email message.  API names of the Salesforce fields can be used within the email content can be dynamic based on the registration information.  See Advanced Features for more information on this feature.

[QUESTION - WITH THE MERGE FEILDS, ARE THEY RESTRICTED TO FIELDS ON A SPECIFIC OBJECT?]

**5. Provide an Org Email**

In the Org Email, enter the email address that should be used for this email. This is the email address that shows as the sender address and will be the address to which the email is sent should they reply to the email.  [I THINK THERE IS MORE TO THIS FOR EXAMPLE, DOES THIS NEED TO BE ONE OF THE ORG WIDE EMAIL ADDRESSES SETUP IN SALESFORCE, IS IT TIED TO A DOMAIN OR SMTP SERVER?]

**6. Provide a BCC Email (optional)**

The BCC Email field, is used for any addtional email addresses that should be blind carbon copy on the message. When entering multiple email addresses, a comma should be used to separate the email addresses.  The blind copy individuals will receive a copy of each message sent.  Note, this text area field allows value that has no more than 1000 characters. 

**7. Choose a Letterhead**

Choose the Letterhead in which your email should be wrapped.  [QUESTION - WHERE DO THESE COME FROM?  ARE THEY CLASSIC OR LIGHTNING?  IS THERE OTHER SETUP THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO HAVE THEM APPEAR HERE?]

**8. Save the new email**

These are all the fields we need to complete for our simple event.  For information about all of the fields, see the Field list below.

*Note: Other Salesforce products such as Pardot and Markting Cloud have much more emailing and engagement features.*
  
*Note: We recommend creating an event email from the Event as this will automatically associate the event with the email. If you go to the Summit Event Emails object and create an event email, you will need to assign an existing event record to the Event field. If the value you input does not match with an existing record, an error will be triggered.*
