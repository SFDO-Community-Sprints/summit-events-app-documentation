##   Important Items and Upgrade Action Steps

This release introduces Person Account support intended to work with newer Education Cloud and Nonprofit Cloud implementations. Plan to validate your matching behavior in a sandbox (including guest registrations) before upgrading production.

Post Deploy Instructions:

  * If you plan to use Person Accounts with Summit Events, review the new matching-related fields on the Summit Events and Summit Events Registration record and confirm your org’s matching/duplicate rule approach aligns with your desired outcomes.
  * Test end-to-end registration flows for:
    * Logged-in portal/community users (if applicable)
    * Guest registrations (including capacity changes on cancellation)
    * Guest registrants added by a primary registrant (if enabled)
   
### Fields To Add to Page Layouts:
If you're upgrading Summit Events, you'll need to add these fields to the page layout depending on how you're leveraging matching records. If you're not using Person Accounts, you do not need to add those fields to the page layout, but you may want to add the fields to allow matching to happen on Guest Registrations.

##   Functional Features, Updates and Bug Fixes

###   Person Account Matching Support for Education Cloud and Nonprofit Cloud [#481](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/481)

Summit Events now includes additional configuration fields on the Summit Events (Event) record to support Person Account matching controls, along with new fields on Summit Event Registration to record Person Account outcomes. A new control field is also available to determine whether matching should run for guest registrants added during the registration process. As part of this deployment, Summit Events is aware of Person Accounts being enabled, so you don't need to turn anything one. You may want to remove the Contact section if you have Peron Accounts enabled.

**Post Deploy Instructions:**
  * Review and optionally update your Summit Events record configuration to use the new Person Account matching controls.
  * Decide whether guest registrants should be included in matching and configure accordingly.

* * *

###   Guest Cancellation Capacity Fix [#616](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/616)

Canceling a guest registration now properly updates Event Instance capacity. This improves accuracy for capacity-controlled events when guests are canceled.

**Post Deploy Instructions:** No action is required, but organizations should validate capacity changes in a sandbox/UAT environment if they rely heavily on guest registrations.

* * *

###   Portal User Registration with Custom Questions Fix [#630](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/Summit-Events-App/issues/630)

Portal/community users can now register successfully when Custom Questions are included in the registration flow. Previously this was erroring and the logged in user could not navigate to the second page, stopping the full registration process.

**Post Deploy Instructions:** No action is required.

* * *

###   Event Cancellation Status Handling Improvement

“Cancel closed” event status behavior has been corrected so event cancellation does not close prematurely.

**Post Deploy Instructions:** No action is required.

* * *

##   Technical Features, Updates and Bug Fixes

###   Contact Matching Engine Rewrite and Bulk Improvements

The `SummitEventsContactMatching` logic has been significantly refactored to improve bulk query handling and to consolidate shared methods used across matching processes. Matching logic has also been enhanced to support guest registrant matching by triggering on update in addition to insert.

**Post Deploy Instructions:** No action is required.

* * *

###   Org/Feature Detection Enhancements

A helper method was added to identify whether Person Accounts are enabled in an org to support appropriate runtime behavior and test coverage across org configurations.

**Post Deploy Instructions:** No action is required.

* * *

###   Developer Tooling and Test Additions

This release includes updates to Apex unit tests for Person Account matching and adds early-stage robot tests for future expansion. A scratch org structure for Education Cloud was also added to support defining it via `cumulusci.yml`.

**Post Deploy Instructions:** No action is required.

* * *

###   Salesforce API Version Update

The project API version has been updated to 64.0.

**Post Deploy Instructions:** No action is required.
