## Technical Features, Updates and Bug Fixes

### Payment Completion Query Update
Moved the payment query executed upon return from the payment gateway to the shared read query path. Previously, some payments did not complete properly because the payment record could not be found after returning to the Summit Events App. This change ensures payment records are located correctly and transactions complete successfully.  

*Post Deploy Instructions:*  
No administrator action is required, but organizations should validate end-to-end payment flow in their sandbox or UAT environment.

---

### Appointment Auto-Add Query Handling
The **auto-add appointment** process has been refactored to use shared read queries for improved data consistency. Appointment types such as “Added,” “Added but not shown,” and “Added and required” are now correctly receipted and reflected as valid appointments.  

*Post Deploy Instructions:*  
No administrator action is required.

---

### Appointment Registration ID Fix
Corrected logic for assigning **Summit Event Registration IDs** to appointments to ensure proper linkage between registration and appointment records.  

*Post Deploy Instructions:*  
No action required.

---

### Unit Test Coverage for Auto-Added Appointments
Added automated test coverage for the **auto-added appointments** process to validate query execution and data relationships in future releases.  

*Post Deploy Instructions:*  
No action required.
